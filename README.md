A fork of [@brenpoly's be-more-agent](https://github.com/brenpoly/be-more-agent) project, built to run fully on-device on a **Raspberry Pi 5** with the **Raspberry Pi AI HAT 2+** (Hailo-10H). BMO listens for its wake word, understands what you say, thinks about it locally, and talks back — no cloud, no subscriptions, no data leaving your house.

This fork adds a browser-based **web interface**, a shared `core/` module layer used by both interfaces, and updated support for the Hailo NPU hardware.

---

## What runs where

| Component | Where it runs | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| LLM (`qwen3:1.7b`) | Hailo-10H NPU | via `hailo-ollama` on port 8000 |
| Vision (`Qwen3-VL-2B-Instruct`) | Hailo-10H NPU | via HailoRT Python API; optional, requires camera; borrows the NPU per photo |
| STT (`whisper.cpp`, `ggml-base.en`) | CPU | ~2.7 s per utterance; NPU Whisper is opt-in, see below |
| TTS (Piper) | CPU | streams sentence-by-sentence while LLM generates |
| Wake word (openWakeWord) | CPU | "Hey BMO" custom model |

### The NPU is single-tenant

This is the most important thing to know about this machine. HailoRT can only
share one physical device between processes via `multi_process_service`, which
needs a `hailort` daemon that isn't installed — and `hailo-ollama` requests an
**exclusive** VDevice regardless. Whichever process opens `/dev/hailo0` first
owns it until that process exits.

So the NPU budget is: **the LLM gets it.** Consequences:

- **NPU speech-to-text is off by default.** `hailo_platform.genai.Speech2Text`
  holds its VDevice for the life of the process, so the first thing BMO ever
  transcribed would permanently starve `hailo-ollama` — BMO could hear you but
  never think again. Set `BMO_NPU_STT=1` to enable it anyway (and accept that
  the LLM will stop working). CPU `whisper.cpp` with `ggml-base.en` is the
  default: ~2.7 s for a 3 s utterance, against ~22 s for `ggml-small.en`.
- **The VLM borrows the NPU per photo** and releases it immediately afterwards.
  Since `hailo-ollama` never lets go on its own, `analyze_image` first asks it
  to unload the LLM (`POST /api/generate` with `keep_alive: 0`, the Ollama
  unload convention), then inits the VLM, then releases the device. The LLM
  lazily reloads on the next chat turn (~5–10 s one-time cost). Photos are
  rare; thinking is not.
- If everything suddenly stops working, the driver is the first suspect — see
  [docs/MAINTENANCE.md](docs/MAINTENANCE.md).

## Interfaces

### On-Device (`agent_hailo.py`)
BMO in its natural habitat. Plug in a screen, a USB mic, and a USB speaker and you get the full experience: animated faces, wake word detection, and the whole listen → think → speak loop running locally. After a response, tap the screen (or the tap button) to speak again without repeating the wake word — the screen shows "Tap to speak" when BMO is ready.

### Web (`web_app.py`)
A FastAPI server with a browser-based UI — useful if you want to talk to BMO from another room, or you'd rather not have a screen hanging off your Pi. Hold a button to record, and BMO responds with audio in your browser.

The web interface includes:
- **Debug panel** — conversation history and live server logs
- **Pronunciation override** — corrects how Piper pronounces specific words
- **LLM status indicator** — shows whether the NPU model is ready
- **Hands-free mode** — enables wake word detection so you don't need to hold the button
- **Pi Audio toggle** — routes audio to the Pi's physical speaker instead of browser playback

---

## Interactive Features

BMO includes several dynamic, interactive capabilities beyond basic conversation:

- **Timers & Alarms:** Ask BMO to *"Set a timer for 10 minutes"* or *"Remind me to check the oven"*. BMO will happily interrupt you later when the time is up!
- **Minigames:** BMO is a living game console. Say *"Let's play Trivia"* or *"Let's play a guessing game"* — BMO will act as the host, wait for your answers, and keep score.
- **Vision Analysis:** Hold an object up to the camera and say *"What am I holding?"* or *"Does this look good?"*. BMO will snap a photo, analyze it using the local VLM, and give you its opinion.
- **Musical Talent:** Ask BMO to *"Play some music"* or *"Sing a song"*, and BMO will cycle into a dancing `Jamming` face while playing chiptunes (add your own `.wav` files to `sounds/music/`).
- **Idle Pet Animations:** When left alone in Screensaver mode, BMO will periodically (and silently) show affection by flashing pixelated hearts, getting dizzy, or falling asleep to keep your desk feeling alive.

## Secure remote access

Modern browsers require HTTPS for microphone access, which makes things awkward when your Pi is just sitting on your local network. [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) solves this elegantly — install it on your Pi and your other devices, enable HTTPS certificates, and you get a proper `*.ts.net` address with a real cert, reachable from anywhere on your Tailnet. No port forwarding, no dynamic DNS nonsense.

> **Disclosure:** I work at Tailscale. That said, I genuinely use it for this project and it's the best solution I've found for exactly this problem.

1. Install Tailscale on the Pi and your client device
2. Enable [HTTPS certificates](https://tailscale.com/kb/1153/enabling-https/) in the Tailscale admin console
3. On the Pi, run:
   ```bash
   tailscale serve --bg --https=443 localhost:8080
   ```
4. Access the web UI at `https://<your-pi-hostname>.ts.net`

Your BMO is then reachable from your phone, laptop, or any device on your Tailnet — mic access works, and it's not exposed to the open internet.

## Hardware

- Raspberry Pi 5 (4GB or 8GB recommended)
- Raspberry Pi AI HAT 2+ (Hailo-10H, required for NPU features)
- USB microphone and speaker (for on-device mode)
- HDMI or DSI display (for on-device GUI)
- Raspberry Pi Camera Module (optional, for vision/photo features)

---

---

## Development

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
ruff check .        # lint — configured in pyproject.toml (bug-classes only)
pytest              # unit tests in tests/unit/
```

`tests/unit/` covers the pure logic that silently corrupted BMO's behaviour in
the past: streaming `<think>` filtering, control-character sanitisation of
LLM payloads, JSON action extraction, timer parsing, transcript cleaning, and
`memory.json` durability. It needs no NPU, no microphone and no display, so it
runs anywhere.

Hardware-dependent behaviour (wake word, speaker output, VLM inference) is not
unit-tested — verify those on the Pi. See [docs/MAINTENANCE.md](docs/MAINTENANCE.md).

- **Lip-Sync Visemes:** BMO's 6 talking mouth shapes were hand-animated by **moorew** using Rhubarb Lip Sync and After Effects — properly articulated visemes trained on real speech, replacing the original procedurally-generated shapes.
- **Community Features:** This fork imports several interactivity and utility features from the upstream `be-more-agent` project, including DuckDuckGo News search, fast nearest-neighbor audio resampling, and robust silence detection (VAD).
- **Hardware Support:** Built for the Raspberry Pi 5 + Raspberry Pi AI HAT 2+ (Hailo-10H).

---

## Features & Recent Updates

- **Gapless TTS:** Piper is held open for the entire speaking turn — sentences stream out one after another with no startup gap between them, so long answers sound natural rather than staccato.
- **Articulate Lip-Sync:** Talking drives a 6-shape viseme palette (closed → tiny lip-crack → small open → round /o/ → wide /a/ → full open) derived from Rhubarb-animated, artist-drawn frames. The OH/WIDE/AH "open vowel" shapes rotate every 120-220 ms during sustained vowels, with an asymmetric attack/release envelope (snappy onsets, slow relax) and a coarticulation gate so the mouth visibly steps through intermediate shapes when closing.
- **Touch-Friendly Volume Slider:** Tap the top-centre of BMO's face to bring up a chunky, BMO-styled volume slider — 60 px knob, 538 px track, big monospace readout, BMO's mouth/tongue palette. Designed for finger taps on the 800×480 panel: tap anywhere on the track to jump, drag the knob to fine-tune. Auto-hides 6 s after the last interaction; settings persist to `settings.json` 400 ms after release.
- **Tap to Speak:** After BMO answers, tap the screen to speak again immediately without re-saying the wake word. BMO shows "Tap to speak" when ready.
- **Persistent Chat History:** Conversations are saved to `memory.json` and reloaded on restart so BMO remembers previous exchanges.
- **Web UI Refactor:** Fully responsive, mobile-friendly interface for interacting with BMO from any device.
- **Improved Aliveness:** Interactive "Pondering" mode — BMO will periodically share fun facts, news, and quirky thoughts when idle.
- **Enhanced Search:** BMO can search for current news and regional information (Canada/Ontario prioritized). Voice turns run web search for weather/forecast/temperature on any phrasing (no question marker needed) and for news/scores/prices on questions; a fast connectivity gate skips search entirely when offline so a dead network can never stall a turn.
- **Reliable voice turns:** pre-warmed Piper is wired to audio before the first sentence (no more silent first answer), the mic stream stays drained during image/music flows so taps are always heard, and an action-only LLM reply now speaks a fallback line instead of silence.
- **Audio Stability:** Fast nearest-neighbor resampling and improved ALSA contention handling for more reliable wake-word detection and voice recording.
- **Desktop Ready:** Includes a `.desktop` launcher (`install.sh` creates it automatically).

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit, current stable)
- `hailo-h10-all` installed — the setup script handles this, but if installing manually: `sudo apt install hailo-h10-all`
- `hailo-ollama` — the setup script builds this from source automatically. If installing manually, see [hailo_model_zoo_genai](https://github.com/hailo-ai/hailo_model_zoo_genai)

### Automated install

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moorew/be-more-hailo/main/install.sh | bash
cd be-more-agent
```

The script handles everything:
- Installs system packages including `libcamera-apps` for camera support
- Fixes the Hailo driver conflict (blacklists the legacy `hailo_pci` module)
- Builds and installs `hailo-ollama` from source if not already present
- Downloads and extracts the Piper TTS engine
- Downloads the `Whisper-Small.hef` for the (opt-in) NPU speech-to-text path
- Clones and compiles `whisper.cpp` as a CPU fallback for STT
- Downloads the `ggml-small.en` Whisper model for CPU fallback
- Creates a Python virtual environment and installs dependencies
- Pulls `qwen3:1.7b` (LLM) via `hailo-ollama`
- Downloads the `Qwen3-VL-2B-Instruct` VLM HEF directly from Hailo's CDN (~3.2 GB)
- Enables system site-packages in the venv so Python can use `hailo_platform`
- Checks camera availability and lets you know if anything's missing

### Manual install

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/moorew/be-more-hailo.git be-more-agent
cd be-more-agent
chmod +x *.sh
./install.sh
```

> Already cloned without `--recurse-submodules`? Run `git submodule update --init --recursive` from inside the repo to pull `whisper.cpp` at the pinned upstream commit. (Or just re-run `install.sh` — it does this automatically.)

---

## Running

**Web Interface (Kiosk Mode):**
```bash
./setup_web.sh
```
This script installs all necessary Python and system audio dependencies, sets up the `bmo-web.service` to start on boot, and configures Chromium to automatically open in full-screen kiosk mode on desktop login.

To manually start/stop the web backend: `sudo systemctl start|stop|restart bmo-web`
To run manually without the service: `. venv/bin/activate && ./start_web.sh`

**On-device GUI (Tkinter):**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
./start_agent.sh
```

**Auto-start LLM & GUI Services:**
```bash
./setup_services.sh
```
Then manage with `sudo systemctl start|stop|restart bmo-ollama` or `bmo-gui`.

---

## Configuration

All settings live in `core/config.py`. The most commonly changed values:

```python
# LLM models (must be pulled via hailo-ollama)
LLM_MODEL       = "qwen3:1.7b"
FAST_LLM_MODEL  = "qwen3:1.7b"

# Vision model — runs directly via HailoRT Python API (not hailo-ollama)
VLM_HEF_PATH    = "./models/Qwen3-VL-2B-Instruct.hef"

# Audio device for local hardware playback (run `aplay -l` to find yours)
# The USB speaker is typically on a different ALSA card from the mic — check both.
ALSA_DEVICE = "plughw:UACDemoV10,0"

# Microphone device index (run `python3 -c "import sounddevice as sd; print(sd.query_devices())"`)
MIC_DEVICE_INDEX = 1
MIC_SAMPLE_RATE  = 48000

# STT: NPU path (Whisper-Small on Hailo-10H) and CPU fallback (whisper.cpp)
WHISPER_HEF_PATH = "./models/Whisper-Small.hef"
WHISPER_CMD      = "./whisper.cpp/build/bin/whisper-cli"
WHISPER_MODEL    = "./models/ggml-small.en.bin"
```

Environment variables override any of these at runtime:
```bash
export ALSA_DEVICE="plughw:2,0"
```

---

## Upgrading to HailoRT 5.3 + Qwen3

HailoRT 5.3 adds **Qwen3-1.7B-Instruct** (LLM) and **Qwen3-VL-2B-Instruct** (VLM). The Raspberry Pi apt repo lags behind upstream, so 5.3 isn't in apt yet — but the vendor packages are available directly from Hailo's CDN. A direct apt upgrade is blocked by package name conflicts (the Pi repo uses `h10-hailort` while upstream uses `hailort`), so the upgrade requires a purge-and-reinstall.

A script handles all of this automatically:

```bash
./upgrade_hailo53.sh
```

The script:
1. Stops BMO services
2. Downloads the three upstream 5.3 `.deb` files
3. Purges the Pi-repo 5.2 packages
4. Installs the 5.3 vendor packages (runtime + DKMS PCIe driver + model zoo)
5. Reloads the kernel module
6. Pulls `qwen3-instruct:1.7b` via hailo-ollama
7. Downloads `Qwen3-VL-2B-Instruct.hef`
8. Patches `core/config.py` with the new model names

The systemd service already passes `OLLAMA_HOST` as an environment variable, so the 5.3 config format change (JSON → env var) requires no changes to the service file.

> **Kernel module note:** The PCIe driver ships as DKMS source and builds against whatever kernel is running. If `/dev/hailo0` disappears after the upgrade, `sudo reboot` is all that's needed.

---

## Dual-model routing

By default, all queries go to a single model (`qwen3:1.7b`). If you want to route longer or more complex queries to a larger model:

1. Pull the larger model via `hailo-ollama`
2. Set `LLM_MODEL` to the larger model name in `core/config.py`
3. Keep `FAST_LLM_MODEL` pointing to `qwen3:1.7b`

Short, simple prompts (under 15 words, no complex keywords) stay on the fast model. Longer or more complex ones go to `LLM_MODEL`. Note that swapping models on the Hailo-10H takes a few seconds on the first query after a switch.

---

## Camera and vision

If you have a Raspberry Pi Camera Module connected:

1. Enable the camera interface in `raspi-config`
2. Install camera tools if not already present:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install -y libcamera-apps
   ```
3. Say something like "Hey BMO, take a photo and tell me what you see" — the agent captures a frame with `rpicam-still` and sends it to the vision model (`Qwen3-VL-2B-Instruct`) running natively on the NPU via the HailoRT Python API

The VLM runs in the agent process, not the LLM server. The NPU cannot be shared (see *The NPU is single-tenant* above), so before each photo BMO asks `hailo-ollama` to unload the LLM, runs the VLM, then releases the device; the LLM reloads on the next chat turn. If the VLM HEF file isn't installed — or no camera is attached — BMO will politely say so rather than crashing.

---

## Customisation

BMO is pretty easy to make your own:

**Personality:** Edit `get_system_prompt()` in `core/config.py`. This is where BMO's voice, tone, and quirks are defined.

**Faces:** BMO's faces are rendered from 33 hand-crafted SVGs in `svg_faces/` by `generate_faces.py`. The generator normalises each face — auto-detecting the content bounding box, centring it in the output, and gently scaling down any oversized expressions — so all 27 states appear at a consistent size on screen. Animations (blink, bounce, shake, mouth cycle) are applied by modifying SVG viewBox coordinates and eye ellipse geometry before rendering via `cairosvg` at 2× resolution (2560×1440) then LANCZOS-downsampling to 800×480. To regenerate all frames: `python generate_faces.py`.

**Expressions:** The LLM can trigger any expression by outputting `{"action": "set_expression", "value": "happy"}`. Available emotions:

| Expression | Description |
|---|---|
| `happy` | Upturned arc eyes with a bouncing smile |
| `sad` | Downturned slash eyes with a frown that droops |
| `angry` | Crossed slash eyes with a flat trembling mouth |
| `surprised` | Big round eyes with a pulsing O-shaped mouth |
| `sleepy` | Closed eyes with floating Z letters |
| `dizzy` | X-shaped eyes with a wavy squiggle mouth |
| `cheeky` | One open eye, one winking, wagging tongue |
| `heart` | Beating heart-shaped eyes (scales up and down) |
| `starry_eyed` | Spinning 4-point sparkle stars for eyes |
| `confused` | One oversized eye, one flat line, wiggly mouth |
| `daydream` | Eyes drifted up with floating thought bubbles *(screensaver)* |
| `bored` | Eyes shifting left and right *(screensaver)* |
| `jamming` | Closed eyes, big smile, bouncing musical notes *(screensaver)* |
| `curious` | One eye pulsing larger than the other, tilted look *(screensaver)* |

**Sounds:** Put `.wav` files in `sounds/<category>/`. BMO picks one at random per event.

**Wake word:** Replace `wakeword.onnx` with any [OpenWakeWord](https://github.com/dscripka/openWakeWord)-compatible model.

**Image Generation:** When BMO discusses highly visual topics (especially during screensaver musings or when explicitly asked), they use the local LLM to generate a descriptive prompt. This prompt is then sent to [Pollinations.ai](https://pollinations.ai/), a free community API that generates the image in the cloud and returns it to the Pi. BMO then applies a custom retro LCD border before displaying it on-screen. This keeps the Pi fast and responsive without needing to run heavy Diffusion models locally!

---

## Screensaver personality

When BMO has been idle for 60 seconds, it enters screensaver mode and cycles through its expressions. Approximately every **30 minutes**, BMO will "think out loud" by:

1. Searching the web for a random topic (weather, news, fun facts, quotes, science, jokes)
2. Feeding the search result to the on-device LLM with a special prompt
3. Speaking the generated thought via Piper TTS

BMO stays quiet during:
- **Night hours** (10 PM – 8 AM)
- **Recent interaction** (within 60 seconds of your last conversation)

This all runs locally — search results go through DuckDuckGo and the LLM processes them on the Hailo NPU.

---

## Troubleshooting

**LLM shows as offline / can't connect to port 8000**

Check if `hailo-ollama` is running:
```bash
sudo systemctl status bmo-ollama
```
If the service isn't set up yet, start it manually:
```bash
export OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0:8000
hailo-ollama serve
```
If `hailo-ollama` isn't found, re-run `./install.sh` — it will build and install it from source.

**Hailo NPU not detected (`/dev/hailo0` missing)**

This is usually caused by a driver conflict. The system ships with both `hailo_pci` (Hailo-8) and `hailo1x_pci` (Hailo-10H) drivers. If the old one loads first, it blocks the new one from creating the device node. Fix it by blacklisting the old driver:
```bash
echo "blacklist hailo_pci" | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-hailo-legacy.conf
sudo rmmod hailo1x_pci 2>/dev/null; sudo rmmod hailo_pci 2>/dev/null
sudo modprobe hailo1x_pci
ls /dev/hailo0  # should now exist
```
The setup script handles this automatically, but if you installed manually you may need to do it yourself.

**Inference fails with `HAILO_OUT_OF_PHYSICAL_DEVICES`**

This means `/dev/hailo0` doesn't exist — see the fix above. Another cause is a process already holding the device; check with `lsof /dev/hailo0`.

**VLM fails with `HAILO_INVALID_OPERATION` / `HailoRTStatusException: 6`**

This usually means the VLM HEF file was compiled for a different HailoRT version. The HEF must match your installed runtime:
```bash
dpkg -l | grep hailort  # check your version (e.g. 5.1.1)
```
Re-download the matching HEF:
```bash
HAILORT_VER=$(dpkg-query -W -f='${Version}' h10-hailort)
# Must match VLM_HEF_PATH in core/config.py (currently Qwen3-VL-2B-Instruct)
wget -O models/Qwen3-VL-2B-Instruct.hef \
    "https://dev-public.hailo.ai/v${HAILORT_VER}/blob/Qwen3-VL-2B-Instruct.hef"
```

**TTS Audio Stuttering / Staccato Speech**

If Piper sounds like it's "tripping" or only playing short bursts of noise, it's likely an ALSA buffer underrun caused by high CPU/NPU load. The default ALSA buffer is 500ms (`--buffer-time=500000`) in `agent_hailo.py`. If it persists, ensure you are using the official 27W Power Supply.

**Mic stops listening (Watchdog Trigger)**

If BMO stops responding to the wake word, the mic stream may have stalled. We've added a 10-second watchdog in the `agent_hailo.py` ear loop that automatically restarts the stream if no data is received.

**Persistent Memory**

Chat history is now persisted to `memory.json`. BMO will remember your previous conversations even after a restart!

**Camera vision says "my eyes aren't working"**

This is the VLM's generic failure line. The most common cause was the NPU being held by `hailo-ollama` — fixed by having `analyze_image` unload the LLM first (see *The NPU is single-tenant*). If it still fails, check that `hailo_platform` is importable:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python3 -c "from hailo_platform.genai import VLM; print('OK')"
```
If it fails, ensure system site-packages are enabled: `grep include-system venv/pyvenv.cfg` should say `true`.

**Voice answers "Could not connect to my brain" on weather/news**

The search result (e.g. the `wttr.in` v2 ASCII-art table) contained box-drawing Unicode / ANSI escapes that crash `hailo-ollama`'s strict JSON prompt renderer mid-request. Fixed: weather uses the compact one-line `wttr.in?format=4` summary and injected search data is ASCII-stripped. If you add a new search source, keep its output ASCII-only before it reaches the LLM.
