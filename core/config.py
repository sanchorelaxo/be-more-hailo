# device between processes via `multi_process_service`, which needs a hailort
# daemon that is not installed — and hailo-ollama requests an exclusive VDevice
# anyway.  So whichever process opens /dev/hailo0 first owns it until it exits.
#
# NPU Speech2Text holds its VDevice for the life of the process.  Enabling it
# therefore permanently starves hailo-ollama the first time BMO transcribes
# anything: every later LLM call dies with HAILO_OUT_OF_PHYSICAL_DEVICES(74)
# and BMO can hear you but can no longer think.  The LLM is the more valuable
# tenant, so NPU STT is opt-in and off by default.
